Hello, some friends of mine and I have made a rust server for people who want their bases to not be destroyed as long as their are active. We welcome anyone as long as they respect other users. We use Oxide, and are ready with a Starter Kit that we can spawn in for you. I hope you will enjoy and remember to read the rules.

3. Do not hack or cheat, this will result in a permanent ban.
4. Do not advertise your own server or anyone else's for any game.
